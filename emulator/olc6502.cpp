    Background
    ~~~~~~~~~~
    I love this microprocessor. It was at the heart of two of my favourite
    machines, the BBC Micro, and the Nintendo Entertainment System, as well
    as countless others in that era. I learnt to program on the Model B, and
    I learnt to love games on the NES, so in many ways, this processor is
    why I am the way I am today.

    In February 2019, I decided to undertake a selfish personal project and
    build a NES emulator. Ive always wanted to, and as such I've avoided
    looking at source code for such things. This made making this a real
    personal challenge. I know its been done countless times, and very likely
    in far more clever and accurate ways than mine, but I'm proud of this.

// bit which remains at 1. An absolute address is read from location 0xFFFC
// which contains a second address that the program counter is set to. This
// allows the programmer to jump to a known and programmable location in the
// memory to start executing from. Typically the programmer would set the value
// at location 0xFFFC at compile time.

// program. Therefore the current instruction is allowed to finish
// (which I facilitate by doing the whole thing when cycles == 0) and
// then the current program counter is stored on the stack. Then the
// current status register is stored on the stack. When the routine
// that services the interrupt has finished, the status register
// and program counter can be restored to how they where before it
// occurred. This is impemented by the "RTI" instruction. Once the IRQ
// has happened, in a similar way to a reset, a programmable address
// is read form hard coded location 0xFFFE, which is subsequently
// set to the program counter.
