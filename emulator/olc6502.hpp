    Background
    ~~~~~~~~~~
    I love this microprocessor. It was at the heart of two of my favourite
    machines, the BBC Micro, and the Nintendo Entertainment System, as well
    as countless others in that era. I learnt to program on the Model B, and
    I learnt to love games on the NES, so in many ways, this processor is
    why I am the way I am today.

    In February 2019, I decided to undertake a selfish personal project and
    build a NES emulator. Ive always wanted to, and as such I've avoided
    looking at source code for such things. This made making this a real
    personal challenge. I know its been done countless times, and very likely
    in far more clever and accurate ways than mine, but I'm proud of this.

    // Addressing Modes =============================================
    // The 6502 has a variety of addressing modes to access data in
    // memory, some of which are direct and some are indirect (like
    // pointers in C++). Each opcode contains information about which
    // addressing mode should be employed to facilitate the
    // instruction, in regards to where it reads/writes the data it
    // uses. The address mode changes the number of bytes that
    // makes up the full instruction, so we implement addressing
    // before executing the instruction, to make sure the program
    // counter is at the correct location, the instruction is
    // primed with the addresses it needs, and the number of clock
    // cycles the instruction requires is calculated. These functions
    // may adjust the number of cycles required depending upon where
    // and how the memory is accessed, so they return the required
    // adjustment.

    // Opcodes ======================================================
    // There are 56 "legitimate" opcodes provided by the 6502 CPU. I
    // have not modelled "unofficial" opcodes. As each opcode is
    // defined by 1 byte, there are potentially 256 possible codes.
    // Codes are not used in a "switch case" style on a processor,
    // instead they are repsonisble for switching individual parts of
    // CPU circuits on and off. The opcodes listed here are official,
    // meaning that the functionality of the chip when provided with
    // these codes is as the developers intended it to be. Unofficial
    // codes will of course also influence the CPU circuitry in
    // interesting ways, and can be exploited to gain additional
    // functionality!
    //
    // These functions return 0 normally, but some are capable of
    // requiring more clock cycles when executed under certain
    // conditions combined with certain addressing modes. If that is
    // the case, they return 1.
    //
    // I have included detailed explanations of each function in
    // the class implementation file. Note they are listed in
    // alphabetical order here for ease of finding.
